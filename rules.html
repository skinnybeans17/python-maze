            <p>This game is a maze, and a quiz mixed into one! In particular, one that focuses on the basics of Python. In this game, there are multiple answers with questions. One button needs to the next page, meaning it's correct, while the others will lead to a dead end, forcing you to go back and try again. There are four difficulty settings, and the difficulty makes more questions for the maze. Easy has 2 per page, medium 3, hard 4, and extreme 5. Each difficulty comes with ten questions each. Are you ready? Go back to choose which you like and start playing! Good luck!</p>
